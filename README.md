# ATM Banking System in Java

## About
This is a console-based ATM system developed in Java that simulates the essential functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine. It allows users to securely log in using an account number and PIN, check their checking and savings account balances, and perform deposits and withdrawals with input validation and formatted output.

The project demonstrates core Java programming concepts including Object-Oriented Programming (inheritance and encapsulation), user input handling with Scanner, and formatted currency display.

## Features
- Secure login with account number and PIN authentication
- Separate checking and savings accounts per user
- View current balances with currency formatting
- Withdraw and deposit money with balance verification
- Menu-driven console interface for easy navigation
- Basic input validation to avoid invalid transactions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
